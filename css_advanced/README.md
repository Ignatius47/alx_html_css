# SmileSchool Project: Mastering Advanced HTML & CSS

## Project Overview

This project is part of the ALX Front-End Development curriculum, focusing on advanced HTML and CSS techniques to build a responsive and visually appealing website. The goal is to replicate a given design from a Figma file, emphasizing precise styling, layout, and responsive behavior across different screen sizes.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I honed my skills in:

* **Advanced CSS Styling:** Implementing complex designs with attention to detail, including custom colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and rounded corners.
* **Responsive Web Design:** Utilizing media queries to ensure the website adapts seamlessly to various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
* **Flexbox and Grid Layouts:** Effectively using CSS Flexbox and Grid for powerful and flexible layout management.
* **Semantic HTML5:** Structuring the content logically and accessibly using appropriate HTML5 tags.
* **External CSS:** Best practices for separating CSS from HTML into a dedicated stylesheet (`styles.css`).
* **Font Awesome Integration:** Incorporating external icon libraries for enhanced visuals.
* **Figma to Code Workflow:** Translating design specifications from a Figma design into functional web code.
